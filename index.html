                        <p>Stardew Valley is an indie game developed and published by ConcernedApe which released on February 26, 2016. You have just inherited
                            your grandfather's delapidated farm in the town of Stardew Valley and it is up to you to bring it back to life. The town of Stardew Valley has
                            a lot to offer the player besides farming - you can chat with the other villagers, jump into the dangerous mines and bring back treasures and 
                            materials, fish in the bodies of water, and many other fun activities.

                            <p>By Monica Garcia<br>

                            </p>
                            <p>Fallout New Vegas is a post-apocalyptic RPG developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Bethesda Softworks. It was released in the U.S. on October
                                19th, 2010. You are a Courier who is in charge of delivering a platinum chip to the mysterious Mr.House, the owner of the New Vegas Strip. However, trouble 
                                finds you on your way as you are ambushed by a group of unknown men. You are shot and left for dead, but a doctor from Good Springs finds you and nurses you 
                                back to health. You do not remember anything about your past so you are left to figure out what you stand for in the Mojave Desert. There are plenty of side 
                                quests to do, characters to meet, and gangs to get in your way or who you can team up with. The choice is yours!
