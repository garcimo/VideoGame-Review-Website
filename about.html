                        <h2>About Us</h2>
                        <p>We are <strong>Peachy Games</strong>, a collective of passionate nerds who want to offer you honest and thorough reviews on video games that you may be interested
                            in trying out. We know that as time goes on, video games are getting more and more expensive as technology gets more advanced and the industry
                            keeps pushing the boundaries that we have come to know in the video game community. We have taken it upon ourselves to write about our thoughts
                            on games that we try out in hopes of making it easier for consumers to know what kind of experience they are jumping into and if they are willing
                            to spend their money on a game or not.
                        </p>
                        <p>As well as our video game reviews, we also offer recommendations for additional video game content that we enjoy, a biweekly newsletter where we 
                            fill you in on video game news and hidden gems that we have come across along the way, a game guide directory if you are stuck on a game and need
                            some help, and a monthly favorites list to see the games that we have been loving lately!
                        </p>
                        <p>As always, <u>thank you for visiting Peachy Games</u>!</p>
